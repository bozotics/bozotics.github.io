What are transistors? May have seen it being thrown around before, here's a
diagram from _The Economist_ abt Moore's Law

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor):

Normally, when we want to turn on and off lightbulbs or other high powered
components, we use a switch.

However, what if we want to control these automatically?

Eg, in a Smart Home, when you reach home you want it to turn on automatically.
You will need a Microcontroller to do that...

Instinctively, we may think of this: using a microcontroller's digital pin
(which you can program to output 1 or 0) to switch the bulb.

however...

From [Arduino's Tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins):

> "pins can source <span class="fragment highlight-red">(provide positive

The arduino only allows for 40mA MAX to be output from it's pins. I wonder how
much amps a lightbulb requires...

Assuming Arduino runs at 5v,

$$Watts=Voltage\times Amps$$

$$2.5W=5V\times Amps$$

$$Amps=0.5A>>>0.04A$$ ðŸ’¥
