Why do we have a maze on our robot's mirror plate?

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">When you first pick it up,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">there is a strange allure to its madness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">You vaguely know where the end point is,</p>
but the path to that end is completely unknown.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">You make your entrance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Corridor by corridor, corner by corner.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Things start moving, progressing,</p>
some say even smooth sailing...

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Then you hit your first dead end.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Confusion ensues.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Retrace your steps.</p>
Find the way out.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Route after route,</p>
Round and round you go.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Passageways once explored</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">out of curiosity and wonderment,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">become familiar alleyways revisited</p>
with disdain and despondency.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">"I mean, there must come a point</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">when I'm back at square one,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">where I've failed so many times,</p>
that only one, *correct*, path remains

...right?"

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Your vision tunnels, your focus sharpens.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Time appears to dilate,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">but the path forward</p>
finally grows clearer.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Yet strangely, as the end draws near,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">the unshakeable feeling of pointlessness</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">over the entire endeavour</p>
only grows stronger.

<!-- After all, 
it is always when 
you're closest to success, 
where the biggest wave of self-doubt 
shall come crashing down. -->

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Ultimately,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">what lies in the centre of it all,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">the "end" of the road,</p>
is just a simple, plain mirror.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">It shows your reflection,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">serving as a reminder </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">that this journey's <i>purpose</i></p>
has always been *you*.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Your strongest motivator;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"> your greatest enemy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Every lesson gained;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">every suffering endured.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The constant stream of bad luck</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">which you have cursed at so passionately</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">as being the work of some evil entity,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">becomes most laughable</p>
in the face of the lifeless environment.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The only dynamic factor</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">the only thing that has changed</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">throughout this course</p>
is you.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Despite gaining clarity</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">over the absurdity of your situation,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">the urge still remains</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">to travel this maze once more,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">this time going the opposite way,</p>
from the inside-out...

just for *fun*.
