Robotics is cruelly ironic.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Behind each flashy robot,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">99% of the time is spent fixing problems</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">arising from our own creation,</p>
instead of actual creation itself.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Beyond its initial novelty,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">99% of the time is filled with</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">anger, desperation, pain, and sadness,</p>
instead of that once familiar feeling of joy and amazement.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">We actively chase that 1% high,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">yet there is never an end in sight;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">for in our desert of aspirations,</p>
that is nothing but a mirage.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Deep within us,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">that vulnerable flame:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">it quivers, it flickers, it sputters,</p>
yet it never stops burning.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Perhaps,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">it is this eternal pursuit,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><em>in itself</em>,</p>
that is enough.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Robotics is cruelly ironic...</p>
but only 99% of the time.
