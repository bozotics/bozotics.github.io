WARNING: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

This section goes into detail about the different modules that make up our robot. One thing you will realise is that we like to take inspiration from many teams, adapting and improving upon their ideas. As much as possible, we will be linking our "references" so that you can check them out yourself and hopefully get inspired by them too!

## Drive system

The drive system is the most important part of the robot, directly dictating the degree of mobility of the robot. Hence, many considerations were put into this part, not only with the motors used, but also the wheel design and their placement

### Motors

The motor we use is the JMP-BE-3561 model by JoinMax ([Website](http://roboexp.com/products/post.asp?pid=34)) ([Datasheet](http://roboexp.com/products/images/201812/3561.pdf)). We first bought this motor back in 2018, which was also the year where this motor made its international debut with lightweight champions, LJ Stand ([Poster](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPh5H2HzPVjt2wpaWPG-9Mnrah6Dkoe2Ghs8lTklUj96C2vK_ss1Fg4HTWEEaDdhg/photo/AF1QipOusXaE-bTkOXWjb3M6T7Pcu6LTusV3T5kNputd?key=dHA1TUNIdHFCR1ZnMnN1T1o4S0NZaGlhMzE0OHpn)). We used this motor for internationals in 2018 too ([Poster](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPh5H2HzPVjt2wpaWPG-9Mnrah6Dkoe2Ghs8lTklUj96C2vK_ss1Fg4HTWEEaDdhg/photo/AF1QipObWPqCdW84jdbp6I86uDTHw8wcNx2Ohzzu-GZ-?key=dHA1TUNIdHFCR1ZnMnN1T1o4S0NZaGlhMzE0OHpn)), and this motor has only seen increasing adoption in the 2019 season.

Out of the box, this motor comes equipped with a planetary gearbox and is built with an angle bracket frame for easy mounting. This is an *extremely* high-powered motor with a no-load speed of 1700 RPM and a stall-torque of 20 kgf·cm, which translates to about 1.96 Nm. To understand how insanely powerful that is, here's a comparison table of its specs to other similarly sized motors from more popular brands. (Notes: no load speed and stall torque are calculated assuming 100% gearhead efficiency, the price is calculated from unit price, and all motors have a nominal voltage of 12 V)

|Motor|Diameter (mm)|No load speed (RPM)|Stall Torque (Nm)|No load current (mA)|Weight (g)|Price (SGD)|

It is clear that no motor even comes close to the JMP motor in terms of offering high speeds, high torque, low weight *and* relatively cheap pricing. However, there is one major disadvantage which is the incredibly high no load current. This motor is a giant power suck and thus, heats up very quickly too. On the other hand, this motor is simply too highly rated for us to ever use its full capabilities in a controllable way, with the fastest speeds used set at about 50% of the full speed. While this means a lot of the motor's capabilities are "wasted", it also means that the negative effect of overheating is somewhat curbed.

A good alternative to our JMP motors would be Maxon's RE motor series, but a single motor with gearhead combo costs 480 SGD without shipping so that's definitely not happening anytime soon...🙃 (yes, we tried requesting for sponsorship under Maxon's [Young Engineers Program](https://drive.tech/en/young-engineers-program) before but they didn't even bother replying us...) Hence, we concluded that the JMP motors were our best option after considering all the factors above.

>Life lesson: When all else fails, China is the answer

### Wheels

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/motor-wheel-exploded-full.jpg" alt="Exploded wheel model" caption="Exploded view of wheel" %}

Our wheels are mostly made up of 3D printed parts. We made the omni-wheels doubled layered instead of single layered so that our robot has greater traction on the field, especially since the mini rollers are quite thin. Each omni-wheel layer contains 15 3D printed mini rollers, which has an hourglass shape. 

Each mini roller is fitted with a [NBR O-ring](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.51532e8dsZMwNp&id=576164717128&_u=730vu5iq5aad) (6 mm diamter, 3 mm thickness) that acts as the tyre. This O-ring has to be stretched a little to wrap around the outer section of the mini-roller before falling in place along the recess of the roller.

Also, a [dowel pin](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=521984195750&spm=a1z09.2.0.0.51532e8dsZMwNp&_u=730vu5iqd166) (2mm diameter, 8mm length) is fitted through the middle of the roller to act as an axle. The centre hole of the roller is slightly smaller on one side such that the dowel pin has to be force through, ensuring that the roller remains rigidly connected in place since its the dowel pin that is spinning freely, not the roller.

Each omni-wheel layer is made up of one thick and one thin 3D printed plate. The thicker plate contains rectangular indents where the mini rollers fitted with the dowel pins will sit in. The size of these rectangular indents took quite some trial and error since their tolerances are very small; they had to be just loose enough to allow the dowel pins to spin freely but just tight enough to prevent it from jittering about too much. The thinner plate fits on top of the thicker plate to act as a cover.

<p class="caption">Wheel assembly process</p>

**Backstory:** These wheels were created to replace our [JMP-BE-6059 wheels](http://www.roboexp.com/products/post.asp?pid=24). The JMP wheels were actually quite good since it uses large rollers and is also double layered. However, the material of its roller is soft rubber, which despite having good traction, was *not durable* at all. These wheels were used by our RoboCup 2018 lightweight team and at the start of the competition, the wheels were almost brand new, but by the end, the rubber rollers were either breaking apart or had completely fallen off, leaving behind the raw plastic roller itself. Attempts to make a Frankenstein wheel out of another JMP wheel ([JMP-BP-1261](http://www.roboexp.com/products/post.asp?pid=14)) which used a harder rubber were tried, but they were much less effective since the harder rubber had little traction. Hence, the need to create our own, more durable wheels arose.

### Positioning

The motors' angles relative to one another can affect the maximum speed of the robot when moving in certain directions. For example, a motor combination with the front angles being larger will result in faster forward movement. Since we wanted the robot to travel equally fast in all directions, as well as to make our holonomic calculations easier, we decided to arrange the motors in a 90 degree fashion. However, arranging them simply in a 90 degree cross would make the catchment areas very small and the solenoid has to be forced in place to fit between the motors. Thus, we came up with a "split cross" arrangement, where the motors were moved apart horizontally while preserving the same angle.

{% include gallery id="gallery1" layout="half" caption="Standard vs Split cross" %}

 This arrangment provides the much needed extra space and expands the catchment area size, while resulting in minimal change in the robot's locomotion characteristics. In the vector diagrams below, the blue vectors represent the wheels' velocities, which is of the same direction and magnitude for both arrangments. Thus, linear motion remains the same. However, with the split cross, the wheels are not perpendicular to its displacement from the robot's centre. Thus, only the perpendicular component (purple arrow) contributes to the robot's angular velocity, which can be easily accounted for in the calculations. (More details about holonomic movement can be found in the [Programming](#sike) section)

## Mirror

In order to view the whole field with only one camera, a curved mirror is used to provide 360 degree vision for the robot i.e. catoptric system.

### Theory

INSERT RAY DIAGRAM AND IMAGE RENDER FOR DEFINITIONS OF TERMS

Note: In reality, light rays reflect off of objects into the camera, but for ease of understanding the rays here represent what the camera sees so the "rays" are perceived as moving in the opposite direction.

There are 3 main parameters in tweaking our catoptric system.

#### Mirror curvature

As the angle of elevation of the mirror profile increases, by law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection), the FOV of the system increases, assuming the mirror diameter remains constant (covers constant amount of camera's FOV).

Although increasing the system's FOV might sound like a good thing, logically speaking, more "information" is cramped into the same image size, so the objects have to become more compressed, which makes them smaller and more distorted. In addition, practically speaking, most of the camera modules we use has a relatively large aperture size (Raspberry Pi Camera V1 has a focal ratio of 2.9), and thus a shallow depth of field. Hence, a mirror with a steep angle may end up having some parts being out of focus.

>Constraint 1: Mirror angle should be minimised.

The rate of change of the angle of the mirror profile per unit distance from the centre (the gradient) is what gives the mirror its unique shape. If the rate of change is a constant, the mirror profile will be a line, forming a conic mirror. If the rate of change is increasing, the mirror profile will be some curve function, often a parabola, forming a parabolic mirror. The characteristics of a conic and parabolic mirror are complement each other.

With a conic mirror, as you move closer to the centre, the angle of incidence decreases. Since the angle of reflection is the same as the angle of incidence, for a unit *n* decrease in the angle of incidence, there is a *2n* decrease in the total deflection angle. Hence, the closer you get to the centre of the mirror, the same angle range represents a smaller distance on the field. This is why the closer the object is to the robot, the more stretched it gets. A conic mirror also has a blind spot which is the region between the angle of reflections drawn when the camera ray angle is at 0 degrees. 

With a parabolic mirror, as you move further from the centre, the angle of incidence increases exponentially. Similar to the logic of the conic mirror, given the same angle range, as the distance from the centre increases, the distance that angle represents on the field increases **exponentially**. Thus, the further the object is from the robot, the greater the compression effect is in the image.

Therefore, the ideal mirror shape should be a mix between a conic and parabolic mirror. For objects further from the robot, a conic mirror should be used to prevent compression of the objects in the image. However, for objects nearer to the robot, a parabolic shape can remove the blind spot of the conic mirror and minimise the stretching effects of the image. This "cone-and-curve" shape is basically a *hyperbola*.

>Constraint 2: Mirror profile should be a hyperbolic shape ("cone-and-curve").

#### Mirror-Camera Distance

The larger the distance between the mirror and camera, assuming the camera's height stays constant, the larger the FOV of the mirror, as long as the mirror size is increased to keep the area covering the FOV of the camera constant.

However, this also means that, given an increase in the mirror-camera distance while keeping the area of the FOV of the camera covered by the mirror constant, to keep the same FOV of the system, the mirror angle can be reduced.

>Constraint 3: Mirror-Camera distance should be maximised.

#### Catoptric System Height

The larger the distance between the catoptric system and the ground, asssuming the mirror-camera distance remains constant, the larger the FOV of the system. This is quite intuitive, since the higher the catoptric system is from the ground, the further the rays can travel and thus the system FOV increases.

>Constraint 4: The catoptric system height should be maximised.

#### Ideal Mirror

Summarising the ideal mirror based on the 4 constraints above, the mirror should be hyperbolic to produce the best image, the distance between the mirror and camera should be maximised so that the mirror angle can be minimised for least distortion, the whole system should be placed as high as possible, all while ensuring the system's FOV is just enough, no more no less.

### Design

Many teams have used an array of mathematical approaches to determine the optimal equation for the mirror's curve. We also tried doing so, referring to [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243774568_Mirror_Design_for_an_Omnidirectional_Camera_with_a_Uniform_Cylindrical_Projection_when_Using_the_SVAVISCA_Sensor) which included a MATLAB program which supposedly derives a mirror equation numerically given a set of parameters. However, we were unable to get the code to work and we felt that this was just an overly complicated way of doing things.

Hence, we came up with our own intuitive, extremely simple, trial and error method with absolutely no math needed. **insert engineer vs mathematician joke here*\*

1. The origin of the drawing symbolises the centre of the base of the robot. Set our camera point to a certain height (arbitrary estimation) above the origin, and set the height of the top part of the mirror. 
2. Draw a 2D side view of the longest diagonal distance across the field, represented as a long horizontal line from the origin. This length is calculated from the rulebook's field dimension drawings.
3. Draw a 120-130 mm vertical line at the end of the horizontal line to represent the goals. This is not a perfectly accurate representation but its an over-estimation so the mirror will see more which isn't a bad thing
4. Draw a line from the camera point that takes the angle of the minimum FOV and extend it such that it intersects with the top of the mirror line. Then, draw a line from the top of the goal to that intersection point. These 2 lines represent the light ray reflecting from the top of the goal to the top of your mirror, which translates to the edge of your image.
5. By law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection), find the normal to the angle bisector of the 2 previously drawn line to get the cone angle.

### Manufacturing

As much as designing the mirror is important, a mirror has to be manufactured properly in order to correctly translate the simulated performance into real life. Based on our research, we found 4 possible ways to make a mirror.

#### Gluing mirror sheets

A 2D net of the mirror shape is wrapped around a model of the mirror shape (usually 3D printed) and glued into place. This is arguably the simplest method to make a mirror. However, only a conic mirror can be made, and the line(s) where the ends of the net meets will be highly distorted.

This is mainly seen in a few lightweight teams e.g. M&A in RoboCup 2019 ([Website](https://bbcrobotics-mna.weebly.com/)), since the mirror needs to see the goals only, which are usually far away, and thus, the problems of a conic mirror is not an issue. Hence, this method was not suitable for us.

#### Molding mirror sheet

A mould of the mirror shape is first created, usually with 3D printing. Next, a mirror sheet, typically made from PVC ([Example](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B003OUJLK8/ref=pe_492632_159100282_TE_item)), is heated up to a high enough temperature (around 300°C) that allows it to be pressed and moulded on to the mirror mould.

This is the most common mirror making method in most RoboCup teams. This can be done purely by hand, or with a vacuum forming machine for even greater accuracy.

INSERT MOULDING VIDEOS?? AND PICS

However, our experience with moulding mirror sheets for the past 2 years had been very unsuccessful. When moulding a parabolic mirror, the result was relatively good, but when moulding the hyperbolic mirror, the "conic" part of the mirror was really bad and it had many weird rings and artefacts that made the image terribly distorted. We suspect this is because along the straight sides, the mirror sheet will be unable to stretch fully to completely take on the straight edge. Also, since our mould is 3D printed, the mirror sheet cannot be heated to a higher temperature, nor can the mirror mould be preheated for easier moulding. Finally, the moulded mirror has to be cut out by hand and put in place by estimation, making it usually off-centred or slightly tilted.

#### Machining with Plating

A mirror model is machined from a lathe, followed by plating with some material to create a mirror finish. Some common examples are chromium electroplating and electroless nickel-phosphorous plating. This is more commonly seen in RoboCup MSL.

We did not opt for this method because we did not have much access to the chemicals and machines needed for these processes, and we had little knowledge about the plating processes to begin with.

#### Machining with Polishing

A mirror model is machined from a lathe again, but to achieve a mirror finish, it is sanded and polished with progressively higher grits instead. This method has been seen in a few RoboCupJunior teams such as InfraReady ([Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MYAywKVQfkX5aLt7Viff9LM5IlGnhgVr)), whom was our biggest inspiration into doing this.

We had thought about machining a mirror directly for a long time already, but we always thought it would be impossible to polish a metal to the point of a mirror finish (based on the limited YouTube videos on this topic). In addition, when asking machining services about the cost of achieving a mirror finish, they quoted the cost of making a mirror to be a staggering 100 SGD, which was why we laid off this method for the past 2 years. However, after seeing the well-documented process of machining and polishing mirror courtesy of InfraReady, we decided to try this out ourselves.

We acquired a [Chinese manufacturer](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.387a2e8d0y4QWl&id=520973338349&_u=g30vu5iq18c0) to create the mirror out of aluminium and a CNC lathe, and it only cost around 11 SGD per piece. 

Following that, we attached the machined mirror to a high-powered drill, which functioned as a lathe. We sanded the mirror with progressively higher grit sandpaper, in the order of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000. This was followed up with using [Autosol](https://www.autosol.com/product_p/1000.htm) metal polish and then finally with [Meguair’s Nxt Generation All Metal Polysh](https://www.autobacs.com.sg/shop/car-care/nxt-generation-metal-polysh/), which was a less abrasive metal polish.

After this first time of polishing, the result was much better than we expected — it was definitely better than the moulded mirrors we had made in the past. However, after some examination, we realised that there were still many small scratches along the mirror surface. 

IMAGES OF SCRATCHED MIRROR

Thus, we re-did the sanding process but with wet sanding, in true *"bozotic"* fashion. Using a plastic bottle as a water sprayer, we started from 500 grit sandpaper and worked our way up to 2000 again before using the 2 metal polishers. This helped improve the image slightly. Although scratches were still visible under examination, the image was already more than acceptable.

However, the mirror sees over the field, which means it is not the most efficient mirror shape. We had done this intentionally just in case the manufactured mirror produced different images from the rendered ones and it was better for the mirror to see more than less. More thoughts on what to improve about our mirror can be found on the [AFI](#sike) page.
