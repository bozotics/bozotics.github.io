## Camera

Currently, we are using RPi camera V1 which is able to capture frames at 640p and 90 FPS. Other options such as RPi camera V2 had a cap of 40 FPS while capturing at full FOV, USB camera has a high latency and OpenMV cameras do not have as much flexibility and processing power (Lower FPS) as the RPi.

## OS (Arch Linux)

1. Write [Arch Linux Arm for Raspberry Pi 3](http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-3-latest.tar.gz) image into an SD card
2. Set-up autologin
3. Install Desktop environment preferably a lightweight one (LXDE) due to the limited RAM of the rpi (Optional)
4. Obtain SSH public keys on both devices (laptop and rpi)
5. Set up DHCP server on rpi (Allow RPi to assign the laptop a static IP address)
6. Install OpenCV with optimization (ARM NEON and VFPV3 enabled)
7. Also install the following packages: libssh and raspicam (modified)


## Programming Language

All of our code is written in C++ as it is more suited for our use of running programs in realtime. In previous years, we used python but aftering uncovering the problems with the language such as slower computational speed and the Global Interpreter Lock, we made a swicth to C++. 

## Libraries Used

These are some libraries that we used in the development of our camera program and GUI

### OpenCv

### LibSSH

### Threading

### QT5

<details markdown=1><summary>todo</summary>

- camera+raspi
  - vs other SBC (jetson nano, tinkerboard, odroid)
  - vs compute module
  - vs raspi 4
  - SD card woes + backup problems
  - initial confusions, python opencv era of reinstalling 100000 times
  - OS considered
    - raspbian (lite)
    - dietpi
    - arch
    - buildroot and why we haven't done that yet
    - bare metal and why we also didn't do that (yet???)
  - include other cameras considered from arducam + issues with V2
