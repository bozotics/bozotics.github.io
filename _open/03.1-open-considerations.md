## COMING SOON

- [ ] general **BRIEF** "history" about our electronics (mostly to showcase
      learning process)
  - [ ] old motor drivers
  - [ ] old sensors
  - [ ] old microcontroller configuration
    - [ ] looking at INPUT and using the Nucleo boards which made us realise
          that there's more than Arduino
  - [ ] old perfboards and first forays into PCB
    - [ ] asplosion (link to below boost circuit)
    - [ ] shift to SMD and challenges faced, what worked what didn't
      - [ ] microscope
      - [ ] drag soldering
      - [ ] lead free lmao
    - [ ] KC's drone and testing with ATMEGA328P
    - [ ] link to bottom pcb design (failures)
  - [ ] PCB design (failures)
  - [ ] too thin power traces in first PCB
  - [ ] 4 layer lmao
  - [ ] ground pour but didn't realise that it was only connected at one point
  - [ ] crosstalk but how we can't prevent it well
  - [ ] design "considerations"
    - [ ] positioning of things close to each other
    - [ ] actually reading datasheets for suggested land pattern
    - [ ] trace width / polygon for power and high speed signals
    - [ ] link to AFI (include below in AFI)
      - [ ] high V right next to 3V3 bad
      - [ ] signals running parallel bad but difficult to prevent, may really
            need more layers
      - [ ] power lines should still be thicker, still abit sketchy
      - [ ] lmao multiplexer power with normal V not analog V
      - [ ] maybe more PCBs stacked in a 3d way as 18cm comes, else don't know
            how to fit everything
