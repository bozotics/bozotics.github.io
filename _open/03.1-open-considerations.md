## COMING SOON

<details><summary>sorry mom</summary>
- general **BRIEF** "history" about our electronics (mostly to showcase
  learning process)
  - old motor drivers
  - old sensors
  - old microcontroller configuration
    - looking at INPUTrcj using the Nucleo boards which made us realise
      that there's more than Arduino
    - at the start being confused between VIN being able to input 12v (wow!)
      and inputting 5v not into VIN but directly into 5v
    - being confused between mega and nano and just accepting that nano would
      process the ultrasonic sensors
  - old perfboards and first forays into PCB
    - asplosion (link to below boost circuit)
    - shift to SMD and challenges faced, what worked what didn't
      - microscope
      - drag soldering
      - lead free lmao
    - KC's drone and testing with ATMEGA328P
    - link to bottom pcb design (failures)
  - PCB design (failures)
  - too thin power traces in first PCB
    - lights flickering every time direction changed, or solenoid kick
    - investigations into motor current draw
      - justin's project, 12A when reversing!
  - 4 layer lmao
  - ground pour but didn't realise that it was only connected at one point
  - crosstalk but how we can't prevent it well
- design "considerations"
  - positioning of things close to each other
  - actually reading datasheets for suggested land pattern
  - trace width / polygon for power and high speed signals
  - link to AFI (include below in AFI)
    - high V right next to 3V3 bad
    - signals running parallel bad but difficult to prevent, may really
      need more layers
    - power lines should still be thicker, still abit sketchy
    - lmao multiplexer power with normal V not analog V
    - maybe more PCBs stacked in a 3d way as 18cm comes, else don't know
      how to fit everything
