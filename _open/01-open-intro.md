## Overview

Our robots are built with a variety of materials and manufacturing techniques. It has two dribblers, with one solenoid for kicking in the front. Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) make up most of our robot's plates for a highly efficient design. A Raspberry Pi running a Pi camera with a hyperbolic mirror gives us a 360 degree view of the field, while a Teensy 3.6 coupled with assorted STM32 microcontrollers runs the robot itself. Bluetooth modules allow the robot to communicate within themselves as well as to our app for debugging.
