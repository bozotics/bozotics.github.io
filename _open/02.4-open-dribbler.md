WARNING: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

The biggest inspirations for our dribblers were from teams Input (2017) ([Poster](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNzufjNPruF_a2l2uguBTrDln-8qcq0lzRuGnhFGGmJst7W1q2AmL1tlUa5VyGCiw/photo/AF1QipNm8Dcsrdlv2ajpmoTiCntz332TiSyYiIxxON4Z?key=aVNHM0UtbTFEZFRUc1lISkV5OEpyN05NWEt2Q0hB), [Blog](http://rcjinput.blog.jp/)), Cat-Bot (2018) ([Poster](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPh5H2HzPVjt2wpaWPG-9Mnrah6Dkoe2Ghs8lTklUj96C2vK_ss1Fg4HTWEEaDdhg/photo/AF1QipNaTZQbfaKwfjPkTyUr9DDqKIPFX6f-iAQgBeP7?key=dHA1TUNIdHFCR1ZnMnN1T1o4S0NZaGlhMzE0OHpn), [Blog](http://catbot.blog.jp/))

## Powertrain

Here is a breakdown of every component that drives our dribbler.

### Motor

The motor we used is a 820 kV (RPM per volt) [brushless motor](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.580d2e8dKon2oz&id=43562751012&_u=h30vu5iqeb10). With a battery at 12V, this gives our dribbler system an input speed of around 9840 RPM.

The motor also has one of its 4 legs on the cross shaped mount sawed off to prevent it from hitting the roller in front.

### Coupler

A 3mm to 3mm [coupler](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.580d2e8dKon2oz&id=570746135775&_u=h30vu5iq28bb) is attached to the motor's axle. The motor cannot drive the gear directly because of two reasons: one, the motor shaft is only 10 mm long so it is too short to hold the gear, and two, the gear was directly epoxied to the axle and sensibly, we definitely did not want to glue the gear to the motor directly.

### Gears

The gear train has a ratio of 12:45:30. This means (assuming 100% efficiency for ease of calculation), the output speed is at 3936 RPM. We made it geared down since the brushless motor was quite low torque and we wanted to ensure the dribbler was strong enough to not stall out.

INSERT GEARBOX IRL

These are all 5mm thick gears machined out of copper and are sold with pre-specified dimensions. ([12 tooth gear](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.580d2e8dKon2oz&id=536549273974&_u=h30vu5iq034d), [20-39 tooth gear](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c.w4002-2738315085.12.5c0c6833HV6CYi&id=596551504894), [40-59 tooth gear](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c.w4002-2738315085.35.5c0c6833HV6CYi&id=618710139247)). These gears have a hole of 3mm diameter and are securely glued onto a 3mm [steel axle](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.580d2e8d99lAlX&id=575411657419&_u=h30vu5iq602a) using [Araldite epoxy](https://www.horme.com.sg/product.aspx?id=1584).

When designing the gear placements, we took the larger radius (tip of gear tooth to centre) to represent the middle gear, while taking the smaller radius (base of gear tooth to centre) to represent the other 2 gears. This gave a half teeth spacing between the gears, which gave just enough leeway for the gears to spin freely while being close enough to not experience gear slippage.

### Rollers

For the rollers that dribble the actual ball itself, we used 2 separate rollers instead of a single cylindrical bar. An obvious benefit of this would be a better hold of the ball since it is centralised and trapped in place in the catchment area.

Separate rollers also spin the ball faster. This is because rollers contact the sides of the ball whereas a bar contacts the middle of the ball. If we draw a line along where the ball is contacted (black line in the figures below), it creates a spherical cap and it is clear that the radius of the spherical cap created with the separate rollers is smaller than the radius of the spherical caps created with the bar (which is essentially the radius of the ball itself). 

{% include gallery id="gallery1" caption="Rollers vs Bar" %}

Thus, given the same speed, the separate rollers can spin the ball faster than a bar since the speed transfer ratio between the roller and the ball is simply the radius of the roller to the radius of the circle along the point of contact. 

Estimates using a [Spherical Cap calculator](http://www.1728.org/sphere.htm) places the roller to ball ratio at about 15.5:25, which puts the maximum ball spinning speed at above 2000 RPM. This video of us measuring the ball's RPM with a laser tachometer proves this calculation to be true.

Each roller is made by coating a layer of silicone around it. We have experimented with a few types of silicone and different brands, and found [Araldite silicone sealant](http://www.zener.com.sg/product/araldite-kitchen-and-bathroom-silicone/) to be the best in terms of grip and durability. The silicone is coated by mounting a 3D printed roller into a special mount that leaves a roughly 5 mm gap between it and a chamfered edge. The silicone is fed into the chamfered edge while the roller is spun slowly with a drill. Once a relatively clean layer of silicone is created, it is left to dry for about a day before being removed and epoxied onto the dribbler axle.

The disadvantage of separate rollers is if one roller has a better grip on the ball, it might generate unwanted sidespin on top of the ball's backspin.  To prevent this, a spacer is placed in between the rollers to keep them a fixed distance apart and it is epoxied to both rollers, ensuring they spin as a single body. The rollers are also typically coated in silicone in pairs to keep them as identical as possible.

## Suspension

In a real match, the robot and ball are always in a dynamic state. Thus, the dribbler must be designed such that it can deal with the varied range of forces acting on the ball. To do so, we made the dribbler with a simple suspension system to absorb large impacts and increase stability.

### Pivot 

The pivot point is extremely important in ensuring the pivoting dribbler is effective. Firstly, the pivot point *must* be lower than the roller's contact point with the ball. From the diagram below, it is clear that with a lower pivot point, when the ball moves into the catchment area, the dribbler's rotation about the pivot point produces a diagonal translation of the dribbler bar in the upwards and backwards direction. With the higher pivot point however, the dribbler bar is translated diagonally upwards and *forwards* for an initial part of the rotation. This opposes the backwards movement of the ball and has a tendency to push the ball out.

Secondly, the pivot point should be located just slightly behind the centre of gravity. We can understand this by looking at the dribbler system as a lever. 

The pivot point cannot be in front of/on the centre of gravity, as this will give the dribbler the tendency to tilt backwards/remain tilted backwards, which is not what we want as we need the dribbler to place some weight on the ball to maintain consistent contact with it.

So, the pivot point must be behind the centre of gravity, but how far? Assuming the upwards force exerted by the ball about the pivot point is less than the downwards force exerted by the dribbler's weight (highly likely since the dribbler has a larger mass than the ball and the ball's acceleration is not that high), the further the pivot point is from the centre of gravity, the larger the minimum upwards force required to tilt the dribbler up.

Hence, the pivot point should only be slightly behind the centre of gravity (it cannot be located too far behind anyways due to size constraints). For design convenience, we simply chose the bottom inner leg of the motor mount as the pivot point. Thus, the circular aluminium rods used to secure the motor in place doubled up as "axles" for the dribbler's pivoting suspension system. A slightly oversized hole held these aluminium rods in place, leaving just enough tolerance that the dribbler can pivot smoothly but not too much that it starts wiggling about.
