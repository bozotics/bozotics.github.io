## Theory

A dribbler works by having a fast moving disk that imparts backspin on the ball, which produces a constant backwards velocity on the ball for it to stay within the catchment area.

Explain the physics

### Positioning 

The positioning of the dribbler's rollers relative to the ball directly determines the nature of the dribbler's ball control.

If the rollers are positioned lower down the ball, the ball's backspin pushes it more towards the rollers. This increases the grip between the roller and ball, increasing the roller to ball energy transfer efficiency, which could result in higher ball speeds. However, there is less control of the ball as 

If the rollers are positioned higher up the ball, there would be 

### Double Dribbler

## Powertrain

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/powertrain.jpg" alt="Powertrain" caption="Dribbler's powertrain" %}

Here is a breakdown of every component that drives our dribbler.

### Motor

The motor we used is a 820 kV (RPM per volt) [brushless motor](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.580d2e8dKon2oz&id=43562751012&_u=h30vu5iqeb10). With a battery at 12V, this gives our dribbler system an input speed of around 9840 RPM.

The motor also has one of its 4 legs on the cross shaped mount sawed off to prevent it from hitting the roller in front.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/dummy_16-9.jpg" alt="Motor mount cut" caption="Bottom leg of mount sawed off" %}

### Coupler

A 3mm to 3mm [coupler](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.580d2e8dKon2oz&id=570746135775&_u=h30vu5iq28bb) is attached to the motor's axle. The motor cannot drive the gear directly because of two reasons: one, the motor shaft is only 10 mm long so it is too short to hold the gear, and two, the gear was directly epoxied to the axle and sensibly, we definitely did not want to glue the gear to the motor directly.

### Gears

The gear train has a ratio of 12:45:30. This means (assuming 100% efficiency for ease of calculation), the output speed is at 3936 RPM. We made it geared down since the brushless motor was quite low torque and we wanted to ensure the dribbler was strong enough to not stall out.

INSERT GEARBOX IRL

These are all 5mm thick gears machined out of copper and are sold with pre-specified dimensions. ([12 tooth gear](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.580d2e8dKon2oz&id=536549273974&_u=h30vu5iq034d), [20-39 tooth gear](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c.w4002-2738315085.12.5c0c6833HV6CYi&id=596551504894), [40-59 tooth gear](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c.w4002-2738315085.35.5c0c6833HV6CYi&id=618710139247)). These gears have a hole of 3mm diameter and are securely glued onto a 3mm [steel axle](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.580d2e8d99lAlX&id=575411657419&_u=h30vu5iq602a) using [Araldite epoxy](https://www.horme.com.sg/product.aspx?id=1584).

When designing the gear placements, we took the larger radius (tip of gear tooth to centre) to represent the middle gear, while taking the smaller radius (base of gear tooth to centre) to represent the other 2 gears. This gave a half teeth spacing between the gears, which gave just enough leeway for the gears to spin freely while being close enough to not experience gear slippage.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/dribbler-gears.jpg" alt="Dribbler gear spacing" caption="Half-teeth spacing between gears" %}

### Rollers

For the rollers that dribble the actual ball itself, we used 2 separate rollers instead of a single cylindrical bar. An obvious benefit of this would be a better hold of the ball since it is centralised and trapped in place in the catchment area.

Separate rollers also spin the ball faster. This is because rollers contact the sides of the ball whereas a bar contacts the middle of the ball. If we draw a line along where the ball is contacted (black line in the figures below), it creates a spherical cap and it is clear that the radius of the spherical cap created with the separate rollers is smaller than the radius of the spherical caps created with the bar (which is essentially the radius of the ball itself). 

{% include gallery id="gallery1" caption="Rollers vs Bar" %}

Thus, given the same speed, the separate rollers can spin the ball faster than a bar since the speed transfer ratio between the roller and the ball is simply the radius of the roller to the radius of the circle along the point of contact. This is also why the rollers were made to be as big as possible.

Estimates using a [Spherical Cap calculator](http://www.1728.org/sphere.htm) places the roller to ball ratio at about 15.5:25, which puts the maximum ball spinning speed at above 2000 RPM. This video of us measuring the ball's RPM with a laser tachometer proves this calculation to be true.

Each roller is made by coating a layer of silicone around it. We have experimented with a few types of silicone and different brands, and found [Araldite silicone sealant](http://www.zener.com.sg/product/araldite-kitchen-and-bathroom-silicone/) to be the best in terms of grip and durability. The silicone is coated by mounting a 3D printed roller into a special mount that leaves a roughly 5 mm gap between it and a chamfered edge. The silicone is fed into the chamfered edge while the roller is spun slowly with a drill. Once a relatively clean layer of silicone is created, it is left to dry for about a day before being removed and epoxied onto the dribbler axle.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/dribbler-roller-making.jpg" alt="Dribbler roller coating" caption="Freshly coated roller in mount" %}

The disadvantage of separate rollers is if one roller has a better grip on the ball, it might generate unwanted sidespin on top of the ball's backspin.  To prevent this, a spacer is placed in between the rollers to keep them a fixed distance apart and it is epoxied to both rollers, ensuring they spin as a single body. The rollers are also typically coated in silicone in pairs to keep them as identical as possible.

## Suspension

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/dribbler-suspension.jpg" alt="Dribbler suspension system" caption="Dribbler's suspension system" %}

A suspension system for the dribbler is necessary for it to absorb large impacts and increase its stability while dribbling. If a dribbler is rigidly connected to the robot, all impacts are fully absorbed by the robot itself, which can cause problems such as the front wheels being lifted up, as shown in the video below.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MCrRQf-StbI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Besides, in a real match, the robot and ball are always in a dynamic (moving) state. Thus, a suspension system can compensate for the varied range of forces acting on the ball in order to maintain full control over it.

### Pivot 

The pivot point's position is extremely important in ensuring the pivoting dribbler is effective.

Firstly, the pivot point should be lower than the roller's contact point with the ball. From the diagrams below, when the pivot point is lower, the dribbler's rotation about the pivot point produces a diagonal translation of the dribbler bar in the upwards and backwards direction, as denoted by the green arrow. With the higher pivot point however, the dribbler bar is translated diagonally upwards and *forwards* for an initial part of the rotation. This opposes the backwards movement of the ball and produces a tendency for the ball to be pushed out. (Note that the degree to which the dribbler is pivoted up has been exaggerated in the diagrams for ease of understanding)

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="Low vs High pivot point" %}

However, a really big brain fart during the desining process was how we mistakenly thought the height of the pivot should be compared to the centre of the dribbler roller instead of the contact point. This resulted in our pivot point actually being slightly higher than the contact point. Luckily, the height difference was too small to make a significant impact, but this will definitely be changed ([AFI](#sike)).

PIC OF DRIBBLER LOWER POINT

Secondly, the pivot point should be located just slightly behind the centre of gravity. We can understand this by looking at the dribbler system as a lever. 

The pivot point cannot be in front of/on the centre of gravity, as this will give the dribbler the tendency to tilt backwards/remain tilted backwards, which is not what we want as we need the dribbler to place some weight on the ball to maintain consistent contact with it.

So, the pivot point must be behind the centre of gravity, but how far? Assuming the upwards force exerted by the ball about the pivot point is less than the downwards force exerted by the dribbler's weight (highly likely since the dribbler has a larger mass than the ball), the further the pivot point is from the centre of gravity, the larger the minimum upwards force required to tilt the dribbler up.

Hence, the pivot point should only be slightly behind the centre of gravity (it cannot be located too far behind anyways due to size constraints). For design convenience, we simply chose the bottom inner leg of the motor mount as the pivot point. Thus, the circular aluminium rods used to secure the motor in place doubled up as axles for the dribbler's fulcrum. A slightly oversized hole held these aluminium rods in place, leaving just enough tolerance that the dribbler can pivot smoothly but not too much that it starts wiggling about.

### Spring

A spring is needed to absorb the impact of a ball (by converting the ball's kinetic energy to elastic potential energy in the spring). It also produces a downwards force that keeps the dribbler pressed against the ball.

Without a spring, the initial impact of a fast moving ball travelling towards the dribbler or the acceleration of the ball into the catchment area by the dribbler's rollers itself can produce a huge amount of force upwards. This causes the dribbler module to "jump" upwards, then come back downwards with the full force of the dribbler's weight, which pushes the ball back out.

The first video is of our current robot's dribbler, but without its spring, and it shows the dribbler module bouncing up and down uncontrollably. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtadQGzcrv8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This second video is of an older robot. The backwards acceleration of the ball caused by the dribbler results in it hitting the circular bar located below the ball with a large force. This produces an upwards force on the ball, causing it to "jump" while rebounding off the back wall.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBCi3XcfkVo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There are 2 ways for placing a coil spring for our dribbler, either it is compressed when lifted or stretched when lifted; both methods work equally well. We chose to use the second method simply because it was easier to design for that. The spring has one end that is hooked onto a stationary bar on the base plate (2nd layer), and another end that is hooked to the upper circular aluminium rod of the dribbler module.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/dribbler-spring.jpg" alt="Dribbler spring" caption="Dribbler's spring" %}

Another factor for consideration is the strength of the spring; it cannot be too stiff nor too soft. An overly stiff spring will result in the dribbler being unable to pivot up when it is dribbling at equilibrium, which means the ball is not fully within the catchment area. On the other hand, an overly soft spring will allow the dribbler to pivot with little resistance, as if the spring isn't there in the first place.

Experimentation with spring stiffness was done with the couple of different sized coil springs we had lying around our lab. We tried with a few random pen springs (all too short, had to be pulled beyond yield point to fit the length needed), a [spring with a 0.8mm section thickness](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=552425572723&spm=a1z09.2.0.0.4a562e8dKGRykx&_u=i30vu5iqe620) (too stiff), and a spring with 0.3mm section thickness (too soft). After some estimation, we bought another type of spring (~0.5mm section thickness) which was about an average between the stiff and soft spring. Surprisingly it worked pretty well!

### Damper

Typically, with a suspension system (e.g. car suspension), a damper is added to absorb the recoil of the spring. However, we did not add a damper to our dribbler because:

1. It was very difficult to find a damper that was both suitably small and weak for our use
2. It would further complicate the design, especially considering our smaller size constraints
3. The spring is rather soft to begin with, so the recoil force is small enough for it to not affect the system too much.

Nonetheless, we will still investigate the possibility of using a damper in our design, especially since many of our inspirations stated above do use an oil damper in their suspension system. Slow motion footage of our dribbler still do show a small amount of oscillations when the robot is moving with the ball, which could be eradicated if we found (or made 🤔) a suitable damper.

## Structure

Finally, a well-designed structure is required to hold all the dribbler's components together. Here's a breakdown of the small parts that actually make up the dribbler.

### Ramp

The ramp is not an actual part of the main dribbler module, but is one of the most important parts that improved our dribbler's performance significantly. This is simply a 3D printed piece that provides a 45 degree plane near the bottom of the ball. 

Previously without the ramp, the ball would move backwards and strike the back plate with a considerable amount of force. By Newton's Third Law, the back plate produces an equal and opposite reaction force that pushes the ball out of the dribbler. This results in a "bouncing" or "repelling" effect, as presented in the video below.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKezmaD2Zs4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Adding the ramp fixed this problem since it redirected most of the backwards force upwards. This not only stopped the ball from bouncing out of the dribbler, but it also improved the dribbler’s performance since most of the backwards force of the ball was used to push itself up into the roller, which increased its grip on the ball.

This piece also doubles up as a light gate with holders for the LED and LDR as well as tiny holes for the legs to fit through and soledered directly to the PCB's through hole pads located underneath. (In hindsight, this isn't that great of an idea since the 3D printed piece has to be semi-permanently stuck to the PCB unless the LED and LDR are desoldered... possible [AFI](#sike) here)

### Bearings

Due to the extremely high rotation speeds of the dribblers' gears, all axles are mounted in bearings to ensure they can spin properly. ([MR63ZZ 3\*6\*2.5mm bearings](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=564771427120&spm=a1z09.2.0.0.4a562e8dWd0Sdf&_u=k30vu5iq4213&skuId=3734919418864))

On the dribbler plates, the bearings are embedded one-way such that they dont fall out on the other end. Most bearings are placed on the inside, facing the gears so no matter how jittery the motion gets the bearing will never fall out.

IMAGE

### Spacers

It might seem weird why we would consider spacers to be a vital part of the design, but there's good reason, mainly from our history of experimenting with dribblers. With the extremely high speeds of the gears, if the gear was be in contact with any of the plates, the friction generated would actually melt the plate itself. The picture below was that of an older dribbler plate that used acrylic gears. The sheer heat generated from the spinning gear melted the plate and now they are fused together and impossible to remove.

CURSED IMAGE HERE

Thus, a 0.7 mm spacer is added to each side of the gear, on top of an additional 1mm gap between the dribbler plates, to prevent such a cursed event from hapenning again (and it has worked pretty well so far).
