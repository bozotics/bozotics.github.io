## Coming Soonâ„¢

<details markdown=1><summary>todo</summary>

- buck
  - failed LM2596 (was the most popular so we tried first)
  - how we chose which to try
  - failed TPS54330
    - originally wanted because low current performance
  - why we went with TPS5430 (simple and worked)
- boost
  - asplosion (don't say here, link to history page before this)
  - misconceptions with how to increase solenoid power
    - kept looking for increased voltage / cont. current
      - attempt to analyse waveform to see how much current it draws but ended
        up getting some weird negative voltage
    - realised capacitors were a thing and really understood what it did from
      the ben 600v boost
  - big fat boost converters of the past
  - why we went with lm2587 in the end
    - MAX1522 failure
    - considered MC34063 and UC3843
    - other topologies
      - flyback and the point where every tutorial showed a flyback
      - charge pump
    - working china breakout board
  - how we switched it
    - single mosfet and smoke, then realised power dissipation was a thing for
      inductive
    - relays for higher A rating but arcing confusion
      - led to questions about our main switch AC ratings
    - single mosfet and no smoke but rlly hot cuz Rds not low enough at 3v3
    - finally double mosfet as a weird "multiplier"
    - zener + rectifier as power dissipation
  - digital POT
    - first time that made the thing blow because it initialised slow
    - put it in parallel with another resistor, so now at the start when
      resistance is infinite it won't blow the IC
    - but in the end decided not to use because no space to route and useless
- ports (xt30, xt60, sh-1.0)
  - jumper wire confusion and wrong direction
  - 6p6c lmao
- level shifting
- things we tried and failed
  - adj POT
  - encoder for wheels
