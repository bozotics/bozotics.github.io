- elec/design
  - high V right next to 3V3 bad
  - signals running parallel bad but difficult to prevent, may really need more
    layers
  - power lines should still be thicker, still abit sketchy
  - lmao multiplexer power with normal V not analog V
  - maybe more PCBs stacked in a 3d way as 18cm comes, else don't know how to
    fit everything
  - wrong dir of sh ports
  - change small mosfet to opto iso
