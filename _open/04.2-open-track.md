## Overview

The camera program is written in C++. It is separated into two sections, the main processing and debugging. These two sections can be found in [camera.cpp](https://github.com/bozotics/GUI/blob/master/cache/current/camera.cpp) and [debug.cpp](https://github.com/bozotics/GUI/blob/master/cache/current/debug.cpp) respectively. Calibration values can be found in [config.txt](https://github.com/bozotics/GUI/blob/master/cache/current/config.txt) which can be edited without recompiling the program.

Our program will launch on startup and enter either competition or debug mode upon selection by the user. The code behind the tracking program will be explained in this article while the debugging will be covered under GUI (next article).

## Tracking

### Considerations

Speed and latency as well as accuracy and reliability were some considerations while we coded our tracking program.

#### Speed & Latency

We wanted a program which could track object **above 60 FPS** with **minimal latency**. Since our robot is moving at high speeds thoughout the game, it is important to have high refresh rates so that the movement of the robot will be fluid. It is also essential for the robot to have minimal latency to avoid low responsiveness and overshooting the ball while tracking it. From past year's experience, our robot would overshoot while moving towards the ball which could be explained by the low FPS and high latency of the program as we were using python back then. 

#### Accuracy & Reliability

We also wanted a program which can track the objects on the field accurately while doing so reliably. Given that we are using a omnidirectional mirror, the images captured will be distorted and minimised. Furthermore, our mirror is not completely smooth, thus the image will be slightly blurred. To compensate for these problems arising from the choice of an omnidirectional mirror, we had to create a program which has high accuracy and reliability at detecting objects. Moreover, we had to discern between the bjects in the field and unwanted objects outside of the field accurately to prevent detecting false postives. 

### Algorithms

We used several algorithms and techniques to achieve the fulfill the considerations we had. 

#### Circular buffer

#### Image Processing

#### Kalman Filter

#### Tried & Abandoned

## Threading

### Precautions 

### Dynamic priority
