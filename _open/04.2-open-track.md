## Overview
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/program_flowchart.png" alt="Cadence and flow" caption="Flowchart of the program" %}

Our program will launch on startup and enter either competition or debug mode upon selection by the user. The code behind the tracking program will be explained in this article while the debugging will be covered under GUI (next article).

## Tracking
