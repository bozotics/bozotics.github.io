<details markdown=1><summary>todo</summary>

- suppliers
  - original: sim lim, sgbotic
  - why we shifted to taobao & e14
  - taobao 101
    - how this relates to part selection (we start the search in taobao)
    - since taobao generally only sells popular components (the big resellers)
      we know which parts should work, we can use that to pick our components
    - experience with bad quality
      - bad tools (drill, angle grinder)
      - bad parts (broken MAX7219, bad solder)
