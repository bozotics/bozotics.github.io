## Coming Soon!

<details markdown=1><summary>todo</summary>

- design "considerations"
  - positioning of things close to each other
  - actually reading datasheets for suggested land pattern
  - trace width / polygon for power and high speed signals
  - link to AFI (include below in AFI)
    - high V right next to 3V3 bad
    - signals running parallel bad but difficult to prevent, may really need
      more layers
    - power lines should still be thicker, still abit sketchy
    - lmao multiplexer power with normal V not analog V
    - maybe more PCBs stacked in a 3d way as 18cm comes, else don't know how to
      fit everything
