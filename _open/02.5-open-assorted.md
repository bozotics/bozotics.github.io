WARNING: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

This section lists out all the remaining components that are too small/unimportant to get an entire section for itself ðŸ™ƒ

## Battery Holder

The battery is usually *the* single heaviest part of the robot (our battery weighs over 300g), thus a sturdy holder for the battery is necessary to prevent it from shifting about and potentially affecting the robot's movement.

Our battery slot is made up of two layers of 3 3D printed pieces that form the outline of a cuboid compartment for the battery. The front 2 pieces form a chamfered opening that allows for easy placement. The width of the opeining of the battery slot was designed to be just about the actual width of the battery. Hence, the battery slot itself is already a "clamp" that holds the battery firmly in place and does not allow it to move about.

The cover to prevent the battery from falling out is a spring-loaded up-down gate that makes it very easy to insert and remove the battery.

## TOF holder

Our TOF holder is a 3D printed frame.

## Handle

The handle is sawed out from a 2 mm alumininum metal plate and is mounted on the 4 main supporting stands of the robot.

Why we choose metal handle + Why mount by 4 points

## Main switch

Our main switch is a missile switch. Why? Because its cool. Yep, that's it.

## Microprocessor placements

Logic behind placements of teensy and raspi

## Layer design

STUFF TO ADD
Monetary costs (BOM?)

Drive system: 
motors used, placement angle
wheel design

Dribbler: design details (gear, bearing, plate, motor, roller, ski ramp)
Solenoid: why only 1, design (solenoid plate, placement)


Mirror: design process, manufacturing process
Mirror plate, mirror plate supporter (trapezium stands)
Camera module: camera cone cover, camera position (height)
