## COMING SOON

This section contains everything related to electronics about our robot:
why we chose certain components, how we designed our circuits, and reasons
for some of our decisions.

- [Considerations](/open/elec/considerations/): Details our design history
  and learning process, as well as how it led to a set of considerations
  we use when designing our circuits
- [Components](/open/elec/components/): Explains our choice of components,
  and alternatives we considered but ultimately rejected

I am (we are) not really meticulous with my documentation: when doing
something, I want to finish it and move on to something else rather than
take the time to document what I just did. We tried to change that with our blog,
but it's still not very frequent or thorough, so pardon me and feel free to reach
out to us if there are any lapses or logical gaps in this section's coverage, or
if there is something you would like to discuss.
