## COMING SOON

This section contains everything related to electronics about our robot: why we
chose certain components, how we designed our circuits, and reasons for some of
our decisions.

- [Design](/open/elec/design/): Details our design considerations
- [Components](/open/elec/components/): Explains our choice of components, and
  alternatives we considered but ultimately rejected
- [Soldering](/open/elec/soldering/): Some tools and methods we tried while
  learning to solder
- [History](/open/elec/history/): Learning process and history of our electronic
  designs

I am (we are) not really meticulous with my documentation: when doing something,
I want to finish it and move on to something else rather than take the time to
document what I just did. We tried to change that with our blog, but it's still
not very frequent or thorough, so pardon me and feel free to reach out to us if
there are any lapses or logical gaps in this section's coverage, or if there is
something you would like to discuss.
