After much [consideration](#sike/history) we have decided on the following
components to be used in our circuit boards.

{% include_relative 03.2.1-open-components-list.md %}

---

## Microcontrollers (µC)

### Main µC

We use a [Teensy 3.5/6](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html) as a main µC
due to its fast processing speed, large number of peripherals and I/O (but not
too much so the overall size was still small), extensive support on Arduino IDE,
and ease of reuse in the future as it was on a breakout board.

%}

We chose the Teensy over other 32-bit µCs such as the Arduino Due, ST's Nucleo
lineup, etc because of its small size and good Arduino IDE support. We also
wanted it to be on a breakout board as it was expensive, so soldering something
like a STM32F4 directly onto our PCB was not a solution.

We are looking at the newer Teensy 4.0/1 µCs, however we are unlikely to switch
away as we do not require _that_ much speed and it is quite expensive to
replace. <!---link to teensy kaboom history--->

### Sub-µC

We use multiple
[STM32F103CBT6](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f103cb.html)
as sub-µCs to process sensor data (e.g. sensor fusion for our IMU) to not slow
our main processor down and allow more tasks to be run parallel to each other.

We chose this IC in particular because we used it before on a Maple Mini, and
the schematics for that are simple enough to understand. Also, it has extensive
support from the
[Arduino STM32 Core](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32), and it
has a very cheap price (cheaper than the popular ATMEGA328P on Taobao!) so we
could solder it down directly without a breakout board.

We did consider other alternatives such as NXP's Freescale (since the Teensy
also used this) and Microchip's ATSAMD (since it had good Arduino support)
lineups. However, the lack of availability and the very low price of the STM32s
on Taobao pulled us in that direction instead.

However, the STM32F103 is quite annoying to solder with the QFP package (we have
broken a few legs before) and we do not saturate the I/O anyways. We are looking
to shift towards smaller µCs with TSSOP packages in the STM32F0 series, and with
that shift away from the Arduino ecosystem.

### Programmers

To program the STM32s, we use
[J-Link OB boards](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.270.76ae5329lH9aOm&id=601672470954)
from Taobao.

%}

They were the best choice since J-Link Edu Mini / Black Magic Probe boards were
not sold locally, and real ST-Links were significantly more expensive locally.
We also wanted to be able to program chips other than STM32s in the future,
hence we preferred the flexibility of J-Links over STLinks.

Currently, we use SH1.0 ports to connect the programmers to the PCB to save
space. We have 6 pins: 3v3, GND, SWDIO, SWCLK, TX, RX. In the future, we would
like to replace the TX/RX with SWO pins to fully utilise peripherals of the ARM
ecosystem and not waste a UART, or even use the
[Real Time Transfer (RTT)](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/)
feature available on J-Links to save on pins since the RTT can work through
SWDIO.

## Motor Drivers

### DC Motor Drivers

We use 4
[VNH5019A](https://www.st.com/en/automotive-analog-and-power/vnh5019a-e.html)
motor drivers to control our motors because it had a high current limit, low
R<sub>ds(on)</sub> so there is minimal heat output, and it had a 3.3v voltage
level. Since we had used the VNH2SP30 motor driver previously, and these two
have similar architectures, we were confident that the motor driver would work
well.

However, we (very recently) discovered that the VNH5019 coasts (leaves the
switches off) rather than brakes (turns all the switches on to short the
terminals) at every "0" in the PWM duty cycle. So far, we have not faced any
issues with this implementation, but Texas Instrument's DRV line could be
considered if any problems come up.

### BLDC ESC

We use 2
[HobbyWing SkyWalker 30A](http://www.hobbywing.com/goods.php?id=407&filter_attr=6345.6463)
ESCs for our [dribbler BLDC motors](/open/mech/dribbler/#motor). We use these
due to the high current limit and cheap price from Taobao.

{% include figure

link='https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.1.785423efcJL6UM&id=14222029428'
%}

However, from our testing our dribbler rarely draws more than ≈2A of current. In
the future, smaller and lighter ESCs can be used. We have been testing small
[HSKRC BLHeli_S ESCs](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c-s.w4002-21603605950.14.965e3cabAhrB4E&id=571193702193),
however as we did not want to waste the ESCs we already had we still use the
large HobbyWing ESCs.

A note of caution: both these ESCs were annoying to control. They both required
5v logic levels, the HobbyWing one needed 50Hz Servo signals, and there was an
initialisation sequence that lasts for ≈3s before the motors can actually turn
on. The BLHeli_S one was also complex as we needed to understand and implement
the OneShot125 protocol. We tried using the DShot protocol to no avail.

## Sensors

### IMU / Compass

We use the [Adafruit NXP Precision IMU](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3463)
because of its accuracy and relatively cheap price. It was also very stable from
our testing, something our past IMU used have struggled with.

{% include figure

alt='Adafruit NXP Precision IMU'
caption='Adafruit NXP Precision IMU'
link='https://www.adafruit.com/product/3463'
%}

However, one downside compared to the popular BNO055 is the lack of a controller
in-built to process sensor fusion algorithms. Hence, we dedicate one sub-µC
solely to IMU sensor fusion tasks to ensure maximum stability and data rate.

### Mouse Sensor

We use the [PMW3360](https://www.pixart.com/products-detail/10/PMW3360DM-T2QU)
on our own breakout board. This is because the sensor was expensive and we
wanted to reuse the sensor easily rather than soldering it directly to our 1st
layer PCB. Moreover, the mouse sensor could only work at ≈3mm from the ground,
and our 1st layer PCB was too high off the ground for the mouse sensor to detect
anything.

We did consider getting COTS breakout boards from
[Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/jkicklighter/pmw3360-motion-sensor/)
however the shipping was way too expensive. This did help us a lot though, since
we referred to their schematics and example code when designing and using our
breakout boards.

We also did consider other mouse sensors like the ADNS9800 and PMW3389 (both
available from the Tindie seller above) however from our research the ADNS9800
had hardware mouse acceleration which may be unsuitable for our purposes, and we
could not source the PMW3389 or other mouse sensors from Taobao.

### Distance Sensor

We use 4
[VL53L1X](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.18.53c9464a8UXNhB&id=600540090714)
TOF sensors on a black breakout board from Taobao. They are accurate, precise
due to a small beam angle, very small, and easy to use.

{% include figure

link='https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.14.56.70295af05mWyTF&id=600811358224'
%}

We chose these as distance sensors over the more common and cheaper ultrasonic
sensors because of the higher data rate, and precision from a small beam angle.
They were also consirably smaller, and advanced functions such as selecting the
FOV.

### Light Sensor

We use 40 white 3528 LEDs and ALS-PT19 phototransistors for our bottom light
sensor ring. <!---explain ring---> These were multiplexed using 74HC4067 ICs.

We chose the ALS-PT19 because it was small (0603 package) and cheap. Previously,
we have used TEMT6000 phototransistors, however they were annoying to solder,
expensive and relatively large (1206 package).

### Camera

We use a RPi 3B(+) with a RPi Camera V1 for ball tracking and localisation due
to its high processing power and flexibility.

## Debugging

### RGB LED Ring

We used 16 WS2812B individually addressable RGB LEDs (Neopixel) in a ring to aid
in our debugging. These LEDs can highlight the direction of the ball, goals,
robots, or any other debugging information without us needing to connect to
serial terminals of the µCs or the RPi.

%}

### Bluetooth

We have a HC-05 bluetooth module for communication between robots as well as
debugging via phones. This communication between robots allows for advanced
strategies like attack / defence role switching, or to "extend" the FOV of the
camera since both robots can be used to help the other localise or track the
ball.

We also plan to eventually make an app for our phones to connect to the robot
via bluetooth for debugging rather than downloading a new program with changed
parameters every time we wanted to tune some parameters or read and debug sensor
values
