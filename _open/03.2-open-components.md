## COMING SOON

- [ ] parts selection
  - [ ] motor driver
  - [ ] ESC
    - [ ] controlling that doomboo + level shifting
  - [ ] sensors + why we do / don't put them in breakout boards
    - [ ] IMU
      - [ ] the shortage
      - [ ] CMPS11 woes
      - [ ] BNO055 salvation, but i2c problems
      - [ ] FXOS8700+FXAS21002 resulting solution / dedicated BNO055 controller
    - [ ] Mouse
    - [ ] Bluetooth
    - [ ] TOF
    - [ ] neopixel ring
    - [ ] light sensor
    - [ ] camera+raspi
      - [ ] vs other SBC (jetson nano, tinkerboard, odroid)
      - [ ] vs compute module
      - [ ] vs raspi 4
      - [ ] SD card woes + backup problems
      - [ ] initial confusions, python opencv era of reinstalling 100000 times
      - [ ] OS considered
        - [ ] raspbian (lite)
        - [ ] dietpi
        - [ ] arch
        - [ ] buildroot and why we haven't done that yet
        - [ ] bare metal and why we also didn't do that (yet???)
      - [ ] link to camera section (include other cameras considered from
            arducam + issues with V2)
    - [ ] things we tried and failed
      - [ ] adj POT
      - [ ] encoder for wheels
  - [ ] power
    - [ ] buck
      - [ ] failed LM2596 (was the most popular so we tried first)
      - [ ] how we chose which to try
      - [ ] failed TPS54330
        - [ ] originally wanted because low current performance
      - [ ] why we went with TPS5430 (simple and worked)
    - [ ] boost
      - [ ] asplosion (don't say here, link to above history)
      - [ ] misconceptions with how to increase solenoid power
        - [ ] kept looking for increased voltage / cont. current
        - [ ] realised capacitors were a thing and really understood what it did
              from the ben 600v boost
      - [ ] big fat boost converters of the past
      - [ ] why we went with lm2587 in the end
        - [ ] MAX1522 failure
        - [ ] considered MC34063
        - [ ] other topologies
          - [ ] flyback and the point where every tutorial showed a flyback
          - [ ] charge pump
        - [ ] working china breakout board
      - [ ] how we switched it
        - [ ] single mosfet and smoke, then realised power dissipation was a
              thing for inductive
        - [ ] relays for higher A rating but arcing confusion
          - [ ] led to questions about our main switch AC ratings
        - [ ] single mosfet and no smoke but rlly hot cuz Rds not low enough at 3v3
        - [ ] finally double mosfet as a weird "multiplier"
        - [ ] zener + rectifier as power dissipation
  - [ ] microcontroller
    - [ ] main controller (teensy vs others, problems with teensy)
    - [ ] "sub" controller (acting as sensors)
      - [ ] why we chose STM32
        - [ ] link to above 328p history, why we eventually didn't use that even
              tho it worked
        - [ ] which others did we consider (freescale since teensy, SAMD since arduino)
        - [ ] why did we eventually choose STM32
          - [ ] bought maple mini and it worked
          - [ ] schematic seemed simple at time when we didnt know anything
          - [ ] cheap as heck cuz china
      - [ ] programmers
        - [ ] initial confusion over what things are
          - [ ] SPI programming
          - [ ] ST-link vs J-link vs BMP vs Nucleo
        - [ ] current setup of programmer + UART debug link
        - [ ] future using SWO / J-Link RTT
      - [ ] why we chose UART
  - [ ] ports (xt30, xt60, sh-1.0)
    - [ ] jumper wire confusion and wrong direction
    - [ ] 6p6c lmao
