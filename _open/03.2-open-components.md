## COMING SOON

<details><summary>sorry mom</summary>
- suppliers
  - original: sim lim, sgbotic
  - why we shifted to taobao & e14
  - taobao 101
    - how this relates to part selection (we start the search in taobao)
    - since taobao generally only sells popular components (the big resellers)
      we know which parts should work, we can use that to pick our components
    - experience with bad quality
      - bad tools (drill, angle grinder)
      - bad parts (broken MAX7219, bad solder)
- parts selection
  - motor driver
  - ESC
    - controlling that doomboo + level shifting
  - sensors + why we do / don't put them in breakout boards
    - IMU
      - the shortage
      - CMPS11 woes
      - BNO055 salvation, but i2c problems
      - FXOS8700+FXAS21002 resulting solution / dedicated BNO055 controller
    - Mouse
    - Bluetooth
    - TOF
    - neopixel ring
    - light sensor
    - camera+raspi
      - vs other SBC (jetson nano, tinkerboard, odroid)
      - vs compute module
      - vs raspi 4
      - SD card woes + backup problems
      - initial confusions, python opencv era of reinstalling 100000 times
      - OS considered
        - raspbian (lite)
        - dietpi
        - arch
        - buildroot and why we haven't done that yet
        - bare metal and why we also didn't do that (yet???)
      - link to camera section (include other cameras considered from
        arducam + issues with V2)
    - things we tried and failed
      - adj POT
      - encoder for wheels
  - power
    - buck
      - failed LM2596 (was the most popular so we tried first)
      - how we chose which to try
      - failed TPS54330
        - originally wanted because low current performance
      - why we went with TPS5430 (simple and worked)
    - boost
      - asplosion (don't say here, link to history page before this)
      - misconceptions with how to increase solenoid power
        - kept looking for increased voltage / cont. current
          - attempt to analyse waveform to see how much current it draws
            but ended up getting some weird negative voltage
        - realised capacitors were a thing and really understood what it did
          from the ben 600v boost
      - big fat boost converters of the past
      - why we went with lm2587 in the end
        - MAX1522 failure
        - considered MC34063 and UC3843
        - other topologies
          - flyback and the point where every tutorial showed a flyback
          - charge pump
        - working china breakout board
      - how we switched it
        - single mosfet and smoke, then realised power dissipation was a
          thing for inductive
        - relays for higher A rating but arcing confusion
          - led to questions about our main switch AC ratings
        - single mosfet and no smoke but rlly hot cuz Rds not low enough at 3v3
        - finally double mosfet as a weird "multiplier"
        - zener + rectifier as power dissipation
      - digital POT
        - first time that made the thing blow because it initialised slow
        - put it in parallel with another resistor, so now at the start when
          resistance is infinite it won't blow the IC
        - but in the end decided not to use because no space to route and useless
  - microcontroller
    - main controller (teensy vs others, problems with teensy)
    - "sub" controller (acting as sensors)
      - why we chose STM32
        - link to above 328p history, why we eventually didn't use that even
          tho it worked
        - which others did we consider (freescale since teensy, SAMD since arduino)
        - why did we eventually choose STM32
          - bought maple mini and it worked
          - schematic seemed simple at time when we didnt know anything
          - cheap as heck cuz china
      - programmers
        - initial confusion over what things are
          - SPI programming
          - ST-link vs J-link vs BMP vs Nucleo
        - current setup of programmer + UART debug link
        - future using SWO / J-Link RTT
      - why we chose UART
  - ports (xt30, xt60, sh-1.0)
    - jumper wire confusion and wrong direction
    - 6p6c lmao
