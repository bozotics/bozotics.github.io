### Microcontroller

We researched extensively and thanks to Ken Chow<!--pls change name---> we
decided on a Teensy:<!---link---> easily obtainable from the local SGBotic shop,
enough I/O (but not too much so the overall size was still small) and fast. The
speed was important as that was the year we made the switch from IR to passive
orange ball, and we didn't know how much computing power we would need to detect
it yet, thus more was better. <!---MOVE THIS TO COMPONENTS--->

<!---teensy 3v3 blow up problems--->

For our 3rd competition in 2019, the next thing to replace was the Nano: we now
know that it is there to serve as a "second core", a sub-processor, and not
solely to process the ultrasonic sensor's data. Although the Nano worked well
for this purpose, we wanted to test something new for future development and
use. Our first instinct was to go with ST's Nucleo lineup as it was the first
non-Arduino MCU we know of thanks to INPUT, and it was quite cheap. However, it
wasn't easily accessible to us as our main supplier was Taobao.com, and the
lineup isn't very popular on there. What was popular though, was the "Blue Pill"
board<!---link---> based upon a STM32F103C8T6, and it was really cheap as well
due to economies of scale. Upon further researching however, it seems to have
some issues with its USB circuitry. We ended up settling on a cloned "Maple
Mini"<!---link---> which was touted as a good alternative at roughly the same
price to the blue pill. <!---MOVE THIS TO COMPONENTS--->

- suppliers
  - original: sim lim, sgbotic
  - why we shifted to taobao & e14
  - taobao 101
    - how this relates to part selection (we start the search in taobao)
    - since taobao generally only sells popular components (the big resellers)
      we know which parts should work, we can use that to pick our components
    - experience with bad quality
      - bad tools (drill, angle grinder)
      - bad parts (broken MAX7219, bad solder)
- parts selection
  - motor driver
    - pololu complicated relationship lmao
    - china red driver
  - ESC
    - controlling that doomboo + level shifting
  - sensors + why we do / don't put them in breakout boards
    - IMU
      - the shortage
      - CMPS11 woes
      - BNO055 salvation, but i2c problems
      - FXOS8700+FXAS21002 resulting solution / dedicated BNO055 controller
    - Mouse
    - Bluetooth
    - TOF
    - neopixel ring
    - light sensor
    - camera+raspi
      - vs other SBC (jetson nano, tinkerboard, odroid)
      - vs compute module
      - vs raspi 4
      - SD card woes + backup problems
      - initial confusions, python opencv era of reinstalling 100000 times
      - OS considered
        - raspbian (lite)
        - dietpi
        - arch
        - buildroot and why we haven't done that yet
        - bare metal and why we also didn't do that (yet???)
      - link to camera section (include other cameras considered from arducam +
        issues with V2)
    - things we tried and failed
      - adj POT
      - encoder for wheels
  - power
    - buck
      - failed LM2596 (was the most popular so we tried first)
      - how we chose which to try
      - failed TPS54330
        - originally wanted because low current performance
      - why we went with TPS5430 (simple and worked)
    - boost
      - asplosion (don't say here, link to history page before this)
      - misconceptions with how to increase solenoid power
        - kept looking for increased voltage / cont. current
          - attempt to analyse waveform to see how much current it draws but
            ended up getting some weird negative voltage
        - realised capacitors were a thing and really understood what it did
          from the ben 600v boost
      - big fat boost converters of the past
      - why we went with lm2587 in the end
        - MAX1522 failure
        - considered MC34063 and UC3843
        - other topologies
          - flyback and the point where every tutorial showed a flyback
          - charge pump
        - working china breakout board
      - how we switched it
        - single mosfet and smoke, then realised power dissipation was a thing
          for inductive
        - relays for higher A rating but arcing confusion
          - led to questions about our main switch AC ratings
        - single mosfet and no smoke but rlly hot cuz Rds not low enough at 3v3
        - finally double mosfet as a weird "multiplier"
        - zener + rectifier as power dissipation
      - digital POT
        - first time that made the thing blow because it initialised slow
        - put it in parallel with another resistor, so now at the start when
          resistance is infinite it won't blow the IC
        - but in the end decided not to use because no space to route and
          useless
  - microcontroller
    - main controller (teensy vs others, problems with teensy)
    - "sub" controller (acting as sensors)
      - why we chose STM32
        - link to above 328p history, why we eventually didn't use that even tho
          it worked
        - which others did we consider (freescale since teensy, SAMD since
          arduino)
        - why did we eventually choose STM32
          - bought maple mini and it worked
          - schematic seemed simple at time when we didnt know anything
          - cheap as heck cuz china
      - programmers
        - initial confusion over what things are
          - SPI programming
          - ST-link vs J-link vs BMP vs Nucleo
        - current setup of programmer + UART debug link
        - future using SWO / J-Link RTT
      - why we chose UART
  - ports (xt30, xt60, sh-1.0)
    - jumper wire confusion and wrong direction
    - 6p6c lmao
