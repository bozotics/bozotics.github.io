<p>This year, Hwa Chong Infocomm and Robotics Society has achieved stellar results at the Robocup Singapore Open and we are honored to send 2 teams to represent Singapore at RoboCup Montreal in June. The JC team, Chicken McNuggets, participated in the RoboCup Junior Rescue Line category and emerged champions. It came as a big surprise to us as we did not expect to win and only barely edged out the team from National Junior College for 1st place after the final round.</p>

<p>After Singapore Open, we decided that our EV3 controlled robot couldn't compete at an international level and thus, decided to switch to Arduino which has much better capabilities and flexibility. It wasn’t an easy task as none of us had any experience with Arduino and we only had less than 2 months to rebuild the robot from scratch.</p>

<h2><strong>Trip overview</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This year RoboCup Internationals was held in Montreal, Canada from 18 June to 22 June, with 4000 participants from 35 countries and over 5000 robots.</p>

<h2><strong>General day-by-day account of competition</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On first day of the competition, we had the opportunity to practice on the practice field after registration. For the first time, we saw the other teams’ robots and we were amazed at the variety and how unique some designs were. Some teams even used different types of microcontrollers and programming language which we had never seen before. </p>

<p>Second day: the competition officially began. After our first run, we realised that our compass wasn’t calibrated properly which caused the robot’s turning to be inaccurate. Thus, we tried re-calibrating but to no avail. Throughout the 4 runs, the compass did not work at all. This was partly due to the difference in magnetic field strength between Singapore and Canada as well as the unreliability of our compass model. In addition, the turning in the evacuation room was not properly calibrated and was not consolidated with the main line tracking program. Hence, there were delays and the program was not finished until the end of the second day. </p>

<p>Third day: The playfields became more complicated and it included an obstacle in the middle of the playfield. Additionally, sticks were added onto the playfield which intentionally covered up a significant portion of the intersections and thus, posed a challenge to us as the sticks got caught underneath the robot and affected the light array values. Thus, we decided that some of us would work on a backup robot after the 5th run, which is controlled by EV3 as the main robot could not function to its fullest potential. It gave us something which we were more comfortable with to fall back on given that all of us our Singapore open robot was controlled by EV3.</p>

<p>Fourth day: For the final day of the team competition, the playfields were merged into 1 single playfield which will have 2 robots running together on a single field at the same time, increasing its difficulty significantly given its extremely long course and the extremely long ramp which proved be too difficult for some teams.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to rectify the line tracking program, many problems cropped up throughout the 10 runs for line tracking and the main robot did not have much success at all.</p>

<h2><strong>Superteam challenge</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Later during the 4th day, the superteam challenge was announced which incorporated many components from soccer while collaborating with another team. With the field divided into 2, we had to work with a team from the United States to collect balls (victims), and deposit the dead and alive victims into their corresponding goalposts without crossing over to the other side of the field. We quickly worked out a strategy which was simple yet innovative and finished with a respectable score. </p>

<h2><strong>Learning points</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a whole, we were disappointed that our robot did not perform as well as we hoped on an international stage. However, it has been a very fruitful and meaningful experience for us all. We came a long way from when we first started working on the robot. We learnt Arduino from scratch within 2 months without much external guidance while juggling our studies at the same time. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another thing we learnt is not to be too ambitious as we wasted valuable time and money on trying to get an OpenMV camera to work for victim detection in the evacuation room, but ended up scrapping the project in favour of a more reliable and simple strategy. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We also got the opportunity to interact with our fellow competitors and learn from each other by watching their runs. We were able to pick out interesting mechanism designs to collect the victims and learn different types of strategies which we never thought of before. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We also had the experience to walk around the venue and see the other leagues in action like small size soccer league, humanoid soccer, industrial league and many more. It exposed us to how diverse the field of engineering and robotics could be. Certainly, it has been an eye opening experience for us.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p> In conclusion, we are extremely grateful for the opportunity to represent Singapore at RoboCup 2018. We made a lot of friends at RoboCup and we learnt alot from others. With the experience we gained, HCIRS will definitely come back stronger and better next year, and will definitely strive to represent Singapore again at RoboCup Sydney 2019.</p>
