<p>Hwa Chong Robotics is a place for like-minded and passionate students to explore the intricacies of the field of robotics. To that end, we participated in all major competitions, be it <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/">VEX</a>, <a href="https://www.robocup.org/leagues/18">RoboCup</a> or <a href="https://wro-association.org/home/">WRO</a>. Through self-guided experimentation with the hardware and software, our team has come up with fairly successful solutions to various problems that organisers have thrown at us, bringing us above and beyond the competition</p>
