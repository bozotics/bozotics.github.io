							<h2 id="coming-soon">COMING SOON</h2>

							<p>
								When we started RoboCup back in 2017, we were given a set of
								sensors that were the leftovers from whatever our seniors used.
								With these sensors, there was little documentation as they were
								usually from JoinMax (the company that produces the RCU and the
								motor we are currently using) and they were obsolete.
							</p>

							<p>
								Making matters worse, a lot of them were already broken from
								years of use, so we were not always sure whether we were doing
								something wrong or whether the sensor itself was broken.
							</p>

							<h3 id="sensors-and-motor-drivers">Sensors and Motor Drivers</h3>

							<p>
								Our first challenge was to get a moving robot. To do so, at the
								very least we needed motor drivers and a compass.<!--- link to components section on IMU --->
								The only motor drivers we were able to find were dual motor
								drivers from JoinMax<!--- link to product page --->
								that had ports which were directly compatible with our motors.
							</p>

							<p>
								At that time, we had not touched Arduino programming yet, and
								the only time we interacted with anything similar was with LEGO
								in the WRO competition. Hence, we had no notion on how the
								Arduino controls the motor driver, and thus was clueless on how
								it even worked. We did not learn about the inner workings of a
								motor yet, thus we assumed that they were magic; that our motor
								could only work with motor drivers that were made for it. This
								cost us a lot of time as we went around finding this exact (very
								old) model of motor driver when most of them were broken
								already. However, looking back this was the main reason we
								wanted to shift away from breakout boards and pre-made modules
								as we wanted to have a high level of understanding and
								integration within our circuits.
							</p>

							<p>
								Learning points: All these misconceptions were cleared only when
								we started programming and thus started to understand how these
								sensors worked. Sensors cannot work without programming or
								wiring, so learning and doing both in tandem is essential to
								ensure full understanding of what you are doing. Also, do make
								use of the multitude of amazing resources available (for free!)
								on the web, or make use of your seniors and other connections to
								ask for help.
							</p>

							<h3 id="microcontrollers">Microcontrollers</h3>

							<p>
								When we were designing our first robot, we were handed an
								Arduino Mega and Nano to use as our microcontrollers.<!---link the arduino stores here--->
								We were told that the Mega was to be used as the main
								controller, and the Nano was there only to process the
								Ultrasonic Sensor’s data. However, using the Arduino Mega was
								way too unsuited for our usage: It cost SGD $50+ to get one, and
								it had too many pins which we would never need. While preparing
								for our 2nd RoboCup in 2018, it was one of the first things we
								wanted to change.
							</p>

							<p>
								One of the main teams that we looked up to at that time (and
								still do) was INPUT RCJ from Japan<!---link--->
								as they were really open with their blog which allowed us to
								learn a lot from them. In particular, while studying their
								poster we realised that they do not use an Arduino, but rather
								they use ST’s Nucleo boards.<!---link--->
								At that time, the concept of microcontrollers was new to us: to
								us, the Arduino was just like the LEGO EV3,<!---link--->
								the only controller that we could use. However this opened up a
								new world of possibilities and choices, and eventually
								influenced our choice of microcontrollers.<!---link--->
							</p>

							<p>While preparing for our</p>

							<h3 id="circuit-boards">Circuit Boards</h3>

							<p>
								Our first circuit boards were copied from our seniors; at that
								time, we didn’t know how to make our own, and we didn’t even
								know what all the wires and connections meant, and so we copied
								our senior’s old circuits. This was seen most clearly with our
								“motor board”, a breakout circuit board for our motor drivers.
								While trying to make sense of how to control a motor driver, we
								referred to our senior’s circuit but failed to understand what
								it did, and ended up copying it wholesale. This kind-of worked
								at first, however as we needed to add more sensors and circuits
								onto our board it quickly got messy and confusing. It got to a
								point where we had 5 different circuit boards, all side by side
								with jumper wires connected between them, when they could have
								been easily integrated into 1 clean circuit board. This lesson
								was the main motivation behind our first PCB<!---link it here--->
								<!---see if have any old photos--->
							</p>

							<h4 id="first-pcb">First PCB</h4>

							<p>
								For our 2nd year competiting in 2018, we wanted to shift away
								from the messiness and inelegance of the past. Seeing as our
								senior team had made a PCB themselves in 2017, we decided to
								design a PCB ourselves where everything was fully integrated and
								we didn’t have to deal with any wires. The first design, very
								surprisingly, worked “fully” without any ad-hoc soldering to fix
								our circuit. However, our entire board was designed with 8 mil
								traces, the minimum trace width in SparkFun’s EAGLE DRC file. We
								did not realise this was a problem until we attempted to power
								our solenoid, slowly increasing the voltage in the boost
								converter until we heard a bang along with some magic smoke.
								This killed everything on the PCB, from the teensy to the 4
								(very expensive) Pololu drivers on there.<!---link to bottom about motor current investigation and boost--->
							</p>

							<p>
								Along with our shift away from messy wires, we also decided to
								use the RJ11 6P6C jack for our connections, since we wanted a
								keyed jack that would ensure we never plug things in the wrong
								way. However, this was way bigger than we anticipated, and now
								we’re left with way too many unused RJ11 jacks and plugs and
								breakout boards in our lab (oops)
							</p>

							<h4 id="shift-to-smd-components-and-ics">
								Shift to SMD components and ICs
							</h4>

							<p>
								Our 2018 PCBs were a step forward compared to the (many) circuit
								boards of yesteryear, but they still didn’t look like PCBs we
								are used to seeing in our computers / electronics. This was when
								we decided to step into the world of SMD components; to
								eliminate all breakout (PCB) boards in our PCB and integrate
								everything into one.
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t easy, as we had to read through datasheets which were
								very foreign to us and try to understand complex terminologies
								when we are just trying to accomplish an easy task. Many of
								these datasheets also contain info that aren’t really important
								to us, like stability or temperature information, and it was
								difficult to filter out the important data from the irrelevant
								ones.
							</p>

							<p>
								A tip if you are just starting out on a similar path: a good
								starting point is the recommended application schematic. Many
								times, apart from Vmax we don’t really need that much info on
								its characteristics, and skip right to the application schematic
								to reference and build our circuit from there. Attempt to
								understand the rationale of every component used in that
								application schematic, that way you can optimise the circuit
								specifically to your needs.
							</p>

							<p>
								<a href="/open/elec/soldering/"
									>We also had a good time trying to figure out how to solder
									these components</a
								>
							</p>

							<h4 id="test-pcb">Test PCB</h4>

							<p>
								Since it was our first time using these ICs directly without a
								breakout board, we were not confident that it would work on the
								first try. We wanted to be able to test these components,
								however we required a 22*20cm PCB since that was the size of our
								robot. “Development Kits” sold by chip manufacturers themselves
								were either too expensive or didn’t really exist for the ICs we
								were testing. Hence, riding on JLCPCB’s USD $2 PCBs under
								10*10cm, we decided to make a “test PCB” which was just a large
								breakout board of the various ICs we were planning to use. This
								proved to be useful: we found problems with our circuits; and
								ICs we wanted to use that weren’t suitable or just didn’t work.
								We have continued this practice for this year (2020), and if you
								are just starting out I would recommend this as well.
